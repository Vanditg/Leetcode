## Username: Vanditg
## Year: 2020
## Problem: 17
## Problem Name: Surrounded Regions
##===================================
#
#Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
#
#A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#
#Example:
#
#X X X X
#X O O X
#X X O X
#X O X X
#After running your function, the board should be:
#
#X X X X
#X X X X
#X X X X
#X O X X
#Explanation:
#
#Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. 
#Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. 
#Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
